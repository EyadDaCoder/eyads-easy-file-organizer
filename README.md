# eyads-easy-file-organizer
A simple and easy non-recursive file organizer to sort your files!
## What you can do
You can organize your files in **2 ways**. You can list keywords and every file with said keywords go in their own folder. Or, you can sort by file extension, each file extension gets its own folder. _Some file extension folders will not be created if there is no filetype associated with it._
## How to use
The organizer is simple enough to operate without any tutorial.
## Installation
Go to the releases tab and download the exe. This tool is not available for Mac or Linux and probably will never be.
